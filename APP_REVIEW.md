# iOS App Store Review Submission - Kindred

## App Review Response (Feb 2026)

### Answers to Apple's Questions:

1. **Does your app upload users' Contacts to your server?**
   No. Kindred processes contacts locally on the device. Contacts are only read to display them for selection and are never transmitted to any external server.

2. **Does your app store users' Contacts on your server?**
   No. All contact data remains on the user's device. Kindred does not have any server-side storage for user contact information.

3. **Will your app share users Contacts information to a third party?**
   No. Contact information is never shared with any third parties. It is used solely within the app to help users set up relationship reminders.

Based on the core functionality and user flow, I recommend the following screenshots to highlight the app's value proposition:

    *   **Content**: Show the main list of contacts with upcoming reminders. Ideally, show a mix of "Birthday Today" and standard "Reconnect" reminders to demonstrate priority sorting.
    *   **Caption**: "Never forget a friend. Stay in touch with smart reminders."

2.  **Add Contact Flow (Cadence Selection)**:
    *   **Content**: The screen where a user selects the frequency of contact (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Every 3 Months, Custom).

3.  **Contact Detail & Interaction History**:
    *   **Content**: A specific contact's profile showing past interaction logs (calls, texts, meetups) and the next scheduled date.
    *   **Caption**: "Track your history. Remember what matters."

5.  **Settings / Notification Preferences**:
    *   **Content**: The settings screen showing customizable reminder times and frequency controls.
    *   **Caption**: "Reminders on your schedule, not ours."
