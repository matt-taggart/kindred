# Task
I want to brainstorm the following with you:
- When there's a popover that shows for purchasing the premium plan, it's hard to see the option to "restore purchase" and "only import 5" button. I want to encourage conversions, but I want to do it in an honest way and not frustrate the user throughout the process. I like the way the modal works and I want to give as much details/make things as clear as possible (including highlighting what the premium plan offers). In the current state of the app, the user might not know that the option to continue with the free plan and only import five contacts is available until they scroll down. I want to make this as clear as possible. Any suggestions for improving this flow?

Please do not code yet, just come up with a plan. If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback.
