Absolutely. Below is a full-sweep microcopy rewrite for Kindred, replacing all “stitched” language with connection- and nurturing-based phrasing, while preserving the quilt/patchwork feeling without leaning on craft mechanics.

This is written as a ready-to-hand-off UX copy system.

Kindred — Microcopy System (Connections & Nurturing)

Core Language Principles

•	Relationships are living, not tracked

•	Time gaps are neutral, not failures

•	Reminders are invitations, not alerts

•	Language supports care, ease, and return

Primary verbs: connect, reach, nurture, tend, hold, remember

Or even softer:

This connection has been resting.

Summary: Language Stack

Context Language Style

Core UX Connected, reach out, in touch

Reminders Gentle, optional, invitational

Reflection Nurture, tend, remember

Long gaps Resting, returning, when ready

If you want next steps, I can:

•	Create a language “do / don’t” list for future features

•	Tailor copy for specific audiences (parents, founders, elders)

•	Write App Store description + onboarding screens

•	Pressure-test this tone against accessibility and trauma-informed UX

This is a really thoughtful product—happy to keep building it with you.
