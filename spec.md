Please review the functionality for reminder push notifications. I would like to make sure that the push notification clearly displays the person's name that we're tring to contact. I believe it's a generic message, but not 100% sure. 





<!-- The design should incorporate our current logic, but adapted to the redesigned screens. Please keep any UI elements in the redesign code that hasn't had logic implemented yet in our existing app that you feel would improve the overall experience of the app and fit in beautifully with our app's branding. -->
