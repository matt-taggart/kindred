# Task
Here's the current state of the app:
- Navigate to the import contacts page.
- Select six contacts (without having a pro account) to import
- Select all six contacts and click "Import and Review" 
- On the "review schedule" page, I'm not notified at that point that I can only import five accounts with the free plan (only in the popup modal asking me to update to pro)

Can you please come up with a detailed plan to make this process more clear for users moving forward? One suggestion would be to add copy on the page saying only five imports are allowed (or only five will be imported rather). Please do not code yet, just come up with a plan. If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback.
