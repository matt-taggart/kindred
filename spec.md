# Task 
Please review the layout and functionality of the main screens of the home screen.
1) Home: Show today's connections. When clicking on the connection, it brings us to a view that shows us an indicator of "Connected with x" and prompts us to choose a method for how we connected, and a corresponding note.

Please evaluate the following: I would like to understand if there's anything that we can do to improve this flow and/or make it more aesthetically pleasing. Here are some thoughts that I want to brainstorm through:
- The color of all of the cards are the same and the contrast may not be optimal
- The height of the cards is too tall, or at least not filled in with enough data (the space between the "connection" header and name is toto large).
- The text is too small to be legible under the name, i.e. "Not connected yet" 
- I want to have some kind of "snooze" or quick note option for easier access (the snooze or ignore option is probably more important here since we're already linking to the user but the quick note might be good to have). Please conduct an analysis and determine your recommended approach





<!-- The design should incorporate our current logic, but adapted to the redesigned screens. Please keep any UI elements in the redesign code that hasn't had logic implemented yet in our existing app that you feel would improve the overall experience of the app and fit in beautifully with our app's branding. -->
