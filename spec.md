# Task
Please read and deeply analyze DESIGN-PROPOSAL.md. Once you've understood the branding/design/UI & UX experience/copy direction, please come up with a detailed step-by-step plan to improve the "Today" page. Since this is considered the landing page for the app, I would like to have more of a call to action via the UX and give users direction over what to do when reminders are due. Please use the frontend-design skill to think about this, and brainstorm potential options.

<!-- Please come up with a detailed plan to make implement. Please do not code yet, just come up with a plan. If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback. -->
