# Task
Please ensure that the flow for importing contacts is as follows:
1) If you haven't added any contacts yet, then show the "Import from Phone" view.
2) If we've already provided contacts (via selection for permissions and making them available to the app), then immediately show them on the "import Contacts" page.
3) Clicking on "Add more contacts" should pull up the menu where I give the app permission to access more contacts
