# Task
Here's the current state of the app:
- On the "Import Contacts" page, we list out specific options to set daily, bi weekly, etc. reminders. However, we do not provide a "custom" option
- We have a "custom" option listed on the next page (review and schedule)

Can you please come up with a detailed plan to implement the "custom" feature on the "Import Contacts" page? Please do not code yet, just come up with a plan. If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback.
