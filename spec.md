# Task
Here's the current state of the app when I try to import more than five users and hit the paywall:
1) Select six users and determine frequency
2) Before importing, select when to start contacting them
3) Hit paywall 
4) When I click "Not Now", in the background the five contacts are added, and the modal is closed, but there's no feedback that this happened, and all six entries look like the frequencies haven't been set

Can you please come up with a plan improve this UI experience? If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback
