# Task
I want to implement the following:
- the ability to add birthday reminders in a contact's profile
- when it's the contact's birthday, then add the birthday reminder to the "today" view
- the reminder for a birthday should look distinct from a "generic" reminder
- if there is both a "standard" reminder and a birthday reminder on the same day, then make sure we display the birthday  reminder since that's the most important one to consider for that day

Can you please come up with a detailed plan to make implement this feature and come up with an aesthetically pleasing, optimal UI/UX. Please do not code yet, just come up with a plan. If anything is unclear, please ask me for feedback.
