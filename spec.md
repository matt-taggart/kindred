# Task 
Please conduct a full-fledged redesign of the app, adhering to the design, colors, flow, and messaging found in the REDESIGN.md file.

The design should incorporate our current logic, but adapted to the redesigned screens. Please keep any UI elements in the redesign code that hasn't had logic implemented yet in our existing app that you feel would improve the overall experience of the app and fit in beautifully with our app's branding.
