# Kindred Elevator Pitches

## Version 1: Warm & Gentle

Kindred is a gentle relationship companion that reminds you to reach out to the people you care about, on whatever schedule feels natural—no guilt, no pressure, just a soft nudge when it's time to connect.

## Version 2: Plain & Direct

Kindred is a relationship manager that tracks your connections and reminds you when it's time to reach out, based on whatever schedule you set for each person—daily, weekly, monthly, or custom.

## Version 3: Feature-Focused

It's a relationship manager app that lets you add and track connections by importing the contacts from your phone. You essentially set a schedule for each person you want to keep in touch with and let the app know how often you want to reach out. It then reminds you at regular intervals when it's time to talk to someone. You can also do a one tap to call or text within the app.
